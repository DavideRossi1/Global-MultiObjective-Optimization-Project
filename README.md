# Global-MultiObjective-Optimization-Project
This repository contains the results obtained during the development of the final project for the Global and MultiObjective Optimization course of University of Trieste. The project consists of the implementation of a driver controller for a car in a simple 2D racing game. Tree-based genetic programming has been used to evolve the controller.
